        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has enabled them to generate unprecedented results from given texts. However, as text inputs become longer, existing encoding methods like CLIP face limitations, and aligning the generated images with long texts becomes challenging. To tackle these issues, we propose <i>LongAlign</i>, which includes a segment-level encoding method for processing long texts and a decomposed preference optimization method for effective alignment training. For segment-level encoding, long texts are divided into multiple segments and processed separately. This method overcomes the maximum input length limits of pretrained encoding models. For preference optimization, we provide decomposed CLIP-based preference models to fine-tune diffusion models. Specifically, to utilize CLIP-based preference models for T2I alignment, we delve into their scoring mechanisms and find that the preference scores can be decomposed into two components: a text-relevant part that measures T2I alignment and a text-irrelevant part that assesses other visual aspects of human preference. Additionally, we find that the text-irrelevant part contributes to a common overfitting problem during fine-tuning. To address this, we propose a reweighting strategy that assigns different weights to these two components, thereby reducing overfitting and enhancing alignment. After fine-tuning $512\times 512$ Stable Diffusion (SD) v1.5 for about 20 hours using our method, the fine-tuned SD outperforms stronger foundation models in T2I alignment, such as PixArt-$\alpha$ and Kandinsky v2.2.

    <section>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <!-- <p><strong>Main Idea:</strong> LongAlign addresses the challenge of encoding long texts for text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models and preference models by introducing a segment-level encoding approach. This method divides long texts into segments, encodes each segment individually, and then merges the resulting embeddings.</p> -->

        <h3>Segment-Level Text Encoding</h3>

        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Although CLIP-like models are commonly used for representation encoding, result evaluation, and reward fine-tuning, existing CLIP-based models have limitations on input text length.</p>

        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>For representation encoding:</strong> We encode each segment (e.g., each sentence) using CLIP and then merge the embeddings. A careful merging strategy is employed to manage special tokens (&lt;sot&gt;, &lt;eot&gt;, &lt;pad&gt;) to avoid issues with duplicated embeddings for these tokens after merging.</li>
        <li><strong>For evaluation and reward fine-tuning:</strong> We introduce a segment-level loss function $\mathcal{L}_{i \succ j}^{\text{seg}}$ that allows CLIP-based preference models to process long texts and produce detailed segment-level preference scores (Denscore). 
        <p>
            \[
            \mathcal{L}_{i \succ j}^{\text{seg}} = \frac{\exp\left(\sum_{k=i}^K \mathcal{R}(x_i, \hat{p}_k) / K\right)}{\exp\left(\sum_{k=i}^K \mathcal{R}(x_i, \hat{p}_k) / K\right) + \exp\left(\sum_{k=i}^K \mathcal{R}(x_j, \hat{p}_k) / K\right)},
            \]
        </p>
        where we split the long-text condition \( p \) into \( K \) segments, denoted as \( \{\hat{p}_k\}_{k=1}^K \).
        </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Preference Decomposition and Reweighting</h3>

        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Preference optimization can effectively enhance T2I diffusion models, but this fine-tuning process encounters significant overfitting challenges.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Preference orthogonal decomposition:</strong> Human preferences can be categorized into text-irrelevant and text-relevant components. The former leads to significant overfitting. Specifically, in CLIP's text embedding, these two components correspond to the common direction $\mathbf{V}$ and the remaining parts.
        </li>
        <img src="data/decomposition.webp" alt="">

        <li><strong>Gradient-reweighted reward fine-tuning:</strong> Fine-tune the diffusion model with a reweighted gradient that minimizes the influence of the text-irrelevant component $\mathbf{V}$, thereby reducing overfitting and enhancing alignment.
        <p>
            \[
            \partial_\theta (1-\mathbb{E}_{x_T, p}\mathcal{R}(x_0^*, p)) \approx -\mathbb{E}_{p}( (\omega (\eta \mathbf{V}) + \mathcal{C}_{P}^{\bot}(p))^T \mathbb{E}_{x_T} \partial_{\theta} (\mathcal{C}_{X}(x_0^*)) ),
            \]
        </p>
        where $\omega$ is the reweighting factor for the common direction $\mathbf{V}$.

The most striking feature of the ship is the presence of a large, elephant-like head at the bow, which is facing towards the viewer. This head is detailed and realistic, with tusks and a trunk that are prominently displayed. The ship is sailing on a body of water, with a clear sky above and a calm, reflective surface below. In the background, there is a rocky outcrop that adds to the sense of a natural, outdoor setting. On the deck of the ship, there are several people visible, although they are too small to discern any specific details about them. The ship is also adorned with multiple flags, which are attached to the mast and the bow. These flags are not detailed enough to identify any specific symbols or insignias. The overall style of the image is realistic with a touch of fantasy, as evidenced by the elephant head and the elaborate carvings on the ship. The lighting and shadows suggest that the image is set during the daytime, with the sun casting a warm glow on the scene. There are no visible texts or brands in the image.</div>

                            <div class="prompt">The image presents a dramatic and surreal scene set against a dark, cloudy sky. Dominating the center of the image is a large, black ring, which appears to be a portal or vortex. This ring is encircled by a halo of light, creating a stark contrast against the dark sky. The light seems to emanate from the center of the ring, suggesting a source of power or energy. Beyond the ring, the sky is filled with clouds that are illuminated by the light from the ring. The clouds are dense and appear to be in motion, adding a sense of dynamism to the scene. The colors in the image are predominantly dark and black, with the light from the ring providing a stark contrast. The overall composition of the image is balanced, with the ring centrally located and the clouds filling the rest of the frame. The use of light and shadow creates a sense of depth and dimension, drawing the viewer's eye towards the center of the image. Despite the fantastical elements, the image is grounded in a realistic aesthetic. The clouds and sky are rendered with a high level of detail, and the colors are naturalistic. This combination of realism and fantasy creates a visually striking image that invites the viewer to imagine what lies beyond the ring.</div>
